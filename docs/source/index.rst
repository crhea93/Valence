Welcome to Valence's documentation!

This read the docs page contains all the information necessary to understand the Valence code structure and to be able to
make changes to the code. If you wish to use the software, please see the primary valence site (https://valence.cascadeinstitute.org/).

We have a description of the code broken down in pieces in order to make it most accessible.
The code is written in a django -> Jquery stack. Therefore, the code is broken down into the backend (django) and frontend (jquery/html/css).

The documentation is by no mean exhaustive. If you have questions or wish to see a new section, please contact us at
