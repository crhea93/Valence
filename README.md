# Welcome to the Valence software tool.

## What is Valence?
Valence is a web app designed to alow researchers to build mind maps (or have subjects build mind maps) on a topic -- these mind maps are known
as cognitive affective maps (CAMs). More information on CAMs and their many uses can
be found on the main Valence website: [https://valence.cascadeinstitute.org/](https://valence.cascadeinstitute.org/).


## What is this repository for?
The purpose of this repository is to allow any researcher to create their own server.
If you simply wish to use Valence (instead of develop it or run your own server), please
follow the instructions on our [main Valence website](https://valence.cascadeinstitute.org/)
or simply make an account on the official server: https://cognitiveaffectivemaps.herokuapp.com/users/loginpage?next=/


## How can I contribute?
If you wish to contribute, please check out the current issues (or make a new one!), or simply email us at thibeaultrheaprogramming@gmail.com to get involved.
We have documentation set up at https://crhea93.github.io/Valence/.
